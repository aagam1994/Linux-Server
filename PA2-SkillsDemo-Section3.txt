# Instructor: Jason Paul

1.  
- On your Linux Mint GUI VM, log in as root.
- Create a group called "skillsdemo" with a GID of 8888.
- Create a new user called "skillsdemo" who is a member of this group. Ensure this user has a proper home directory at /home/skillsdemo created automatically.
- Add the newly created "skillsdemo" user to the "sudo" group.

2.  
- As root, in your /tmp directory, create a file called "userlist.txt".
- Run a command to assign the user and group ownership of this file to your "skillsdemo" user and group.
- List the files and show this file has the correct ownership settings.

3. 
- As root, using octal values, change the file permissions on this file to:
  - Allow the owning user to have full access
  - The owning group to have read/write access
  - Others to have no access.
- List the files and show this file has the correct permissions.
  
4. 
- Ensure that you have a "skillsdemo" user on your Rocky Linux CLI server that you can log in as. You may need to create this.
- Ensure that SSH client is installed on your Linux Mint GUI machine, and the SSH Server is installed and running on your Rocky Linux CLI machine.
- Adjust any firewall rules as necessary to allow connection from the Linux Mint GUI machine to the Rocky Linux CLI server via SSH.
- Ensure that you are able to SSH from your Linux Mint GUI machine to your Rocky Linux CLI server with the "skillsdemo" user.

5. 
- On your Linux Mint GUI machine, in a terminal, switch to your "skillsdemo" user.
- As this user, run a command to generate an SSH keypair (public/private):
  - Using an RSA key type
  - Storing the keys in the .ssh folder in the user's home directory. Use a relative filepath from the user's home directory.
  - Naming the keys "skillsdemokey".

6. 
- As the "skillsdemo" user, run a command to send your generated SSH public key to the Rocky Linux CLI server.
- Demonstrate logging into the Rocky Linux CLI server with that SSH key and no password.

7. 
- In your Linux Mint GUI, open a Firefox web browser window. If it is not installed, install Firefox.
- In your terminal window, execute a command that will unconditionally terminate the Firefox browser process by name.

8. 
- On the Rocky Linux CLI server, install the nginx web server.
- Configure it to run on port 8888.
- Test this by going to http://serverIPaddress:8888. Provide screenshots.


9. 
- On the Rocky Linux CLI server, install PostgreSQL.
- Log in as the database super user.
- Create a role called "sysadmin" with CREATEDB access.
- List all roles to confirm the "sysadmin" user has the proper attribute.  Provide a screenshot.
- Log in as the "sysadmin" user and create a database called "ntwk8141". Provide a screenshot.

10. 
- Create a Bash script that takes in one parameter when executed, and does the following:
- If the parameter is "skillsdemo", loop 3 times and output the text "Project" each time.
- If the parameter is "exam", loop 4 times and output the text "Study" each time.
- If the parameter is anything else, output "Error" once, and end the script.
- Demonstrate the script working for all three of these scenarios. Provide screenshots.
